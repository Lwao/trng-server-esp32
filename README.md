# True random number generator server with ESP32

Regarding the importance of true random number generation, this work proposes a network topology of a true random number generator (TRNG) from a ESP32 hardware with wireless connection that can be accessed by Python clients within a wireless local area network (WLAN) and return 32 bits random numbers.
